# Reflection on my Intended Design
Follow the instructions and write the report in this file.

For several of the diagrams, my intended design has far less examples than the diagrams made for the monopoly game. There's no missing classes from my diagram compared to the monopoly designs, they're just structured in different ways. In my object diagram I had classes like UI and computerplayer, mostly because I didn't want to miss anything. These classes probably aren't needed. I also noticed that there are some differences in naming. For example, I added to word 'object' after each of the objects in my object diagram, which the monopoly diagram didn't. There are also some differences in the relations between obejcts. For example, I had 'board' and 'player' point to 'Game', in the monopoly class diagram, it was the other way around. I used dependency/association to link the classes together. 

Code was pretty divided to different classes in my diagrams, and I used dependency/association to link the classes together. For example in my class diagram though, classes like PropertyTile and Game has most of the 'code'. The differences in the object diagram there were for ex. me having more classes (UI, computerplayer). My sequence diagram was also far less complex than the monopoly game sequence diagram, which has more methods and more complex relations between classes etc. I'm overall not very happy with mhy initial design, I didn't have a lot of time to complete it so it was a bit rushed. For the next time I'll plan my time better and take more time to fully understand relations, behaviours, all the classes and what they do etc. 

From this assignment I learned that in OOP, everything can be displayed in a diagram like the ones we created. This was very interesting to see, and I can see now why people use OOP and diagrams, since it's much easier to see what classes exist, what behaviours different objects has, and much more.
